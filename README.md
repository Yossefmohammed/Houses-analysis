# Housing Data Analysis

This project contains an in-depth analysis of housing data using Python and various data analysis libraries. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook format, providing a comprehensive exploration of housing market trends and patterns.

## Overview

The `data-analysis-houses.ipynb` notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on housing data, likely including features such as:
- Property characteristics (size, rooms, location)
- Price analysis
- Market trends
- Geographic distribution
- Property value factors

## Notebook Structure

The notebook follows a typical data analysis workflow:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Visualization
5. Statistical Analysis
6. Insights and Conclusions

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- geopandas (if geographic analysis is included)
- folium (if interactive maps are used)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
4. Run the cells in sequence to see the analysis

## Key Analysis Areas

The notebook likely covers:
- Price distribution analysis
- Correlation between features
- Location-based insights
- Property characteristics impact on value
- Market trends visualization
- Statistical modeling of housing prices

## Visualization Features

The analysis includes various visualizations such as:
- Price distribution plots
- Feature correlation heatmaps
- Geographic maps (if location data is available)
- Time series plots (if temporal data is included)
- Box plots for feature comparisons
- Scatter plots for relationships

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Run all cells to see the complete analysis
3. Modify parameters or add new analysis as needed
4. Export visualizations for presentations or reports
